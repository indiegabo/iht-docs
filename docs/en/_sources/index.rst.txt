IndieGabo's Handy Tools!
========================

Welcome to IndieGabo's Handy Tools documentation! Hurray!

About this project
------------------

This is a collection of handy tools for Unity Game developers. Specially 2D driven ones.

My goal is to make easy to use and iterative components so you can either use them as they are 
or use them as a start point to creating something awesome for your game.

Current Version
---------------

   * b-0.0.1

This is a beta test version. I am currently working on a CharacterController2D and i believe that as soon as it is finished, we can call
the package stable enough to get an 1.0.0 version.
