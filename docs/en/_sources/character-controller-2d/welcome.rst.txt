CharacterController2D
=====================

Welcome to IndieGabo's CharacterController2D.

Who is this for?
----------------

If you are creating a 2D game in Unity and want to control character's movement, attacks and other stuff... well... here are some handy 
scripts and other assets for you.

How to use
----------

Ok. Another Character Controller 2D. Why... WHY GABO?

Well... as off this day I still urge creating something valuable for the game dev community. And I know that
using another developer's code and trying to evolve from it can get a bit messy and hard achieve. 

So hear me out: My goal is to detect how I can create components that you can just attach to your objects and 
use them to perform something usefull for that ``GameObject``. But as I currently understand, it is never THAT simple.
There will always be some piece of information that are needed to perform a task, or some information to be passed on
to another component... Then everything becomes referencing everything and it is hard to keep track on stuff.

That got me thinking and i've come up with what I call "the crafting principles" i use to make all these interactions as easy as possible while crafting a component. 
And more. The folowing principles lead you on how to interact with my components in case you need to create your own solutions. 

Checkout the :ref:`crafting principles page <cc2d-crafting-principles-page>` for more info about how i proceed crafting components.
